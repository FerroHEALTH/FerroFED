//! The `healthcheck` job: asks the console running beside it whether it
//! answers, for a container runtime that has no HTTP client of its own.
//!
//! The job connects to the configured listen port on loopback, sends
//! `GET /health` with a short timeout, and reports the outcome as one line.
//! It exits `0` only on `200`, which is what a Docker `HEALTHCHECK` reads as
//! healthy (<https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#healthcheck>). No
//! specification governs health probes: our own design.
