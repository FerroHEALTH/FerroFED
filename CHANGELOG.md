# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Maintenance rule: every pull request that changes user-visible behaviour adds
an entry under **[Unreleased]** in the same PR. Cutting a release renames
[Unreleased] to the version and date, and adds a fresh link reference.

The architecture is the output of the research program on the v0.0.1
milestone, which produces `docs/architecture.md`. Releases on the 0.0.x line
start with the repository, its gates and its documentation; the gateway
binary follows from v0.0.2.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The Business Source License 1.1 with Vernum Projecten B.V. as the Licensor
  and copyright holder (#1), and the contribution-licence terms, the
  pull-request checkbox and the `contribution-licence-guard` check (#3).
- The working discipline under `.claude/`: the rules, the hooks (no AI
  attribution, dangerous-command guard, format and comment-style on edit,
  the SessionStart tracker summary), the issue-loop skills, the
  `spec-researcher` and `implementer` agents, and the tracked project memory.
  `CLAUDE.md` states the product, the design-phase status and the hard rules
  (#6), with the identifier-hygiene rule for everything the gateway composes
  for a node.
- The vendored specification corpora under `docs/specs/`, each with a
  `PROVENANCE.md` and a fetch script under `scripts/vendor/`: the Federation
  Tier with AQL specification at v0.9.0 (release candidate, CC0 1.0), its
  reference implementation (Apache-2.0) as evidence, the openEHR ITS-REST
  1.1.0 OpenAPI documents and the openEHR AQL 1.1.0 source with its grammar
  (#7).
- One pin matrix, `docs/VERSIONS.md`, and `scripts/checks/versions.sh`, the
  guard that fails on drift between the matrix and every file repeating a pin
  (#8).
- The GitHub setup: issue and pull-request templates, CODEOWNERS, Dependabot,
  the label set and tracker helpers under `scripts/gh/`, and the CI workflows
  (the tier-1 guards with the Rust tier gated until a workspace exists, one
  `conclusion` check, CodeQL, Scorecard and SonarQube Cloud), and
  `docs/ci-cd.md`, the design of the workflows and the repository settings
  (#9, #10, #11).
- The community and governance set: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`,
  `SUPPORT.md`, `AI_STATEMENT.md`, `CITATION.cff`, `llms.txt`, and the root
  toolchain, format and lint configuration (#15).
