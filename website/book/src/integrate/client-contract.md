# The client contract

A client of a federation gateway is an ordinary openEHR client. This page sets
out what the specification promises that client. FerroFED serves the
federated query at `POST {base}/v1/query/aql` once a registry is configured;
every other ITS-REST path under `/v1/` answers `501` (N32).

## What a client sends

A conformant openEHR AQL request to `POST {base}/v1/query/aql`, where `{base}`
is the deployment's ITS-REST base URL; no prefix is mandated (§4.1, N28). The
patient is identified the openEHR way:

```sql
SELECT c/uid/value AS composition_id, c/context/start_time/value AS start_time
FROM EHR e CONTAINS COMPOSITION c
WHERE e/ehr_status/subject/external_ref/id/value = '12345'
  AND c/archetype_node_id = 'openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.encounter.v1'
```

No federation-specific syntax is needed for a basic patient query (§3.2, N1).
An optional AQL extension, `FROM ENDPOINT …` and `ORGANISATION …`, pins a
query to named systems for a client that wants it (§8).

## Pinning a query to named systems

Put the directive at the start of `FROM`, and the gateway asks exactly the
endpoints it lists (§8.1, N11):

```sql
SELECT c/uid/value AS composition_id
FROM ENDPOINT p [ "node_1", "node_2" ]
  CONTAINS EHR e CONTAINS COMPOSITION c
WHERE e/ehr_status/subject/external_ref/id/value = '12345'
```

`FROM ORGANISATION [ "org-a" ] CONTAINS …` asks every endpoint the registry
lists as managed by each organisation (N20). The identifiers are the stable
registry identifiers of `meta.federation.endpoints[].id`, never URLs (§8.1,
N19), and the keywords are case-insensitive like every AQL keyword.

- The directive does not replace finding the patient. Each listed endpoint
  is still asked about its own `ehr_id` for the patient (N7, N11). A listed
  endpoint where the patient is not known is reported `not-resolved`, and the
  query still answers `200` (§8.1, §11.3).
- Every registry endpoint the directive does not list is reported `excluded`.
  It is not asked and does not clear `meta.federation.complete` (§11.1).
- No node receives the directive. The gateway sends each node standard AQL,
  so the node query is the same as for the undirected request (N7).
- An identifier the registry does not know is refused `400` with
  `endpoint-unknown` or `organisation-unknown`, before any node is asked
  (§8.4.1). A known organisation that manages no endpoint leaves the request
  without a destination, `404` with `no-destination`.
- A query directed at one endpoint may use what a fan-out refuses: an
  aggregate, which goes to the node unchanged (N14, §11.6.3), and a function
  AQL does not define. Pinned to more than one endpoint, the same query
  follows the rules for an undirected one.
- The variable (`p` above) may only be selected, as an ENDPOINT attribute such
  as `p/id` (§9.3). Selecting one answers `501` with `not-implemented`:
  adding those columns to the rows is planned build order. Using the variable in `WHERE`,
  in `ORDER BY` or inside a function, or binding its name again in `FROM`, is
  refused `400` with `endpoint-variable`.
- The `openEHR-federation-endpoint` and `openEHR-federation-organisation`
  request headers, the other targeting mechanism of §8.4, are planned build
  order.

## What a client gets back

An openEHR `RESULT_SET` exactly as ITS-REST 1.1.0 defines it, rows as ordered
arrays matched to `columns` (§9.1). A client that parses the AQL response of a
single CDR parses a federated one. Everything the federation adds lives in one
member of the open `meta` object, `meta.federation`:

- `complete`, whether the answer covers every node in scope (§11.4);
- `endpoints[]`, one entry per node with its status and provenance (§9.5,
  §11.1);
- `timeout`, the budget that applied (§11.5);
- `dedup`, the de-duplication policy that applied (§10).

By default you get every row every node returned, duplicates included
(§10.1, N15). Send `openEHR-federation-dedup: version-identity` to get one
copy of a composition version held at several nodes: the copy from the CDR
that created it when that CDR answered, else the one from the lowest
endpoint id. Version ids and system ids that differ only in case name the
same thing (openEHR BASE), and the kept row comes back as its node sent it.
The gateway then orders the version uid without regard to case too, in an
`ORDER BY` on it and as the tie-break, so the page a `LIMIT` cuts does not
depend on the case a node wrote it in (§11.6.1).
`meta.federation.dedup` then names the endpoints whose
copies were dropped and counts the rows (§10.2, §10.3). Two versions of one
composition are two rows either way, and `none` states the default
explicitly. Any other value is refused `400` with the code `dedup-invalid`.

Read whether an answer is complete from `meta.federation.complete`, never
from the status code; the gateway emits no FHIR `OperationOutcome`, because
its answer is an ITS-REST `RESULT_SET` (§11.4, N17).

A request that fails answers the status §11.2 names and a stable code; the
[errors and status codes](errors.md) page lists every one.

## Follow-ups

A composition id in a result row is an `OBJECT_VERSION_ID`, which already
carries the `creating_system_id` of the CDR that created it. A follow-up read
or write sent to the gateway is routed to that CDR (§7.2, §12). A new object
is always created on one node the client names; creation across nodes is
refused (§2.3, N23).

## Self-description

`OPTIONS {base}/` returns the gateway's self-description, including what it
refuses rather than approximates, validated against the specification's
`options-root.schema.json` (§7a.2).
