//! A wiremock `MockServer` that is dropped outside the test's runtime.
//!
//! Dropping a `MockServer` verifies its mocks through
//! `futures::executor::block_on`, which takes a `tokio` lock. Inside a
//! `tokio` task whose cooperative budget is spent, that lock answers
//! `Pending` and leaves its wake-up to the runtime the drop is blocking, so
//! the thread parks for good
//! (<https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/coop/index.html>). A test that
//! makes many in-process calls before it drops a node reaches that state.
//! [`Server`] drops the `MockServer` on a thread of its own, which has no
//! budget to spend. No specification governs this: our own design.
