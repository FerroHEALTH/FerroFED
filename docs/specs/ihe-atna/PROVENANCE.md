## What is here

`Volume2/ITI-20.html` is the whole Record Audit Event transaction: the
Send Audit Event syslog interaction (§3.20.4.1) with its trigger events and
the store-and-forward a sender that cannot reach its repository keeps
(§3.20.4.1.1), the syslog message semantics and transports (§3.20.4.1.2), and
the IHE Audit Trail Message Format (§3.20.7). The page's stylesheets, scripts
and logo serve no reader here and are not taken. The supplement adds the
ATX: FHIR Feed Option (ITI TF-1 §9.2.7.1) and the FHIR Feed interactions of
ITI-20: Send Audit Resource Request (§3.20.4.2), its mapping from the DICOM
audit message to the FHIR `AuditEvent` (Table 3.20.4.2.2.1-1) and the
Send Audit Resource Response (§3.20.4.3). The status is the document's own:
a Trial Implementation supplement may be amended before it is incorporated
into the Technical Framework.
