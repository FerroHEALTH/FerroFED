## What is taken

The documents the GF-Authentication pages of the Netherlands Generic
Functions IG cite for the entity identifier (DID 1.0, the did:web method and
DID Resolution, GFI-001), the credential and its presentation (VC Data Model
1.1, GFI-002 and GFI-004) and revocation (Bitstring Status List 1.0,
GFI-003). DID Resolution and Bitstring Status List are the verifier's side of
the exchange; they are taken because the IG binds them, so the record of
what the track requires is complete.
