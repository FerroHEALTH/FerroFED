# Provenance: the Mitz closed authorization question

Vendored by `scripts/vendor/mitz.sh`, each artefact pinned by its
URL and the sha256 of its bytes. Never edit a file here: change the pins in
the script and the pin-set digest in docs/VERSIONS.md, and re-run the script.

- Pin-set digest (sha256 over the sorted `mode  file  url  sha256` lines of
  the pins): `1f0196ab826e5093f6f7b8cbb935b106c22e19b6f9b246d4cce8c157602a14cd`
- Fetched: 2026-10-04, with the User-Agent `ferrofed-vendor (scripts/vendor)`
- Artefacts: 0 committed, 3 cache only, 0 needing
  manual retrieval
- Files in this directory: 0 besides this one, each verbatim as the
  publisher serves it
- Tree digest (sha256 over the sorted per-file `sha256  path` listing,
  `PROVENANCE.md` excluded): `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`
- Read by: #475 (the closed authorization question of `crates/nl-generic-functions` feature `mitz`, its harness service in `tools/ferrofed-testkit`, and the Mitz consent pre-filter of `app/ferrofed-identity`)

The documents of the VZVZ Mitz afsprakenstelsel that define the closed
authorization question of Annex B §B.6, attachments of the Confluence page
"Bijlage Architectuurdocumenten" (page id `828314367` in space `MA11`,
<https://vzvz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MA11/pages/828314367/Bijlage+Architectuurdocumenten>),
readable without an account. Each download URL redirects to the Atlassian
media store. None states a licence, so each is cache only and this
repository carries none of their content.

Examined and not taken: the FHIR package `vzvz.fhir.mitz` 3.8.0 on
packages.fhir.org (tarball sha256
`f36b10fb7fbf4aa5f7ae76ddc3a99b9cfcdb0b9beaec1aba0344ac739832f7fe`), whose
Consent, Subscription and notification profiles serve the subscribe, notify
and migrate interfaces and define no closed authorization question, its
`package.json` stating no licence; the `VZVZ` GitHub organisation, which
publishes no Mitz repository; and the other attachments of the page, which
define no part of the closed authorization question.
