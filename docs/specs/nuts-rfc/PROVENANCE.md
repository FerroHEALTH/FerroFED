## What is taken

The three documents the B.4 track of the Federation Tier specification's
Annex B rests on: RFC021, the grant the client side sends; RFC003, the
authorization server and access token it replaces; and RFC022, the service
discovery a participant reaches another's authorization server through. The
other RFCs (the network, the registry, the credential formats of the earlier
Nuts node) and the repository's images serve no reader here and are not
taken.
