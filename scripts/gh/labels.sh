# scripts/gh/labels.sh: bootstrap the FerroFED issue-label taxonomy.
#
# Creates (idempotently) the labels the tracker workflow assumes:
#   * the WORK-KIND labels a Task carries to pick its commit type
#     (documentation/chore/refactor/perf/test/ci); a Bug and a Feature carry
#     none, because the native issue type already says fix or feat;
#   * the DOMAIN labels, one per conformance surface;
#   * the AREA labels, one per product part with its own crate;
#   * a few workflow labels.
# The type of an issue (Bug, Feature, Task) and its priority (Urgent, High,
# Medium, Low) are NOT labels since 2026-10-02: they are GitHub's native issue
# type and the organisation's Priority issue field, set with
# scripts/gh/fields.sh. The six labels that carried them before (bug,
# enhancement, P0 to P3) are deleted here, so a re-run converges a repository
# that still has them. Run scripts/gh/migrate-fields.sh first on a repository
# whose issues still carry them, or the old values are lost with the labels.
#
# `gh label create --force` updates an existing label in place, so re-running
# this is safe and converges the colours and descriptions to the values below.
#
# Taxonomy policy: no specification governs it: our own design.
# Official docs: https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_label_create
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gh/labels.sh
#   scripts/gh/labels.sh --self-test
#       Drives this program against a stub gh on PATH: every label is created
#       with --force, a retired name is deleted only when the repository
#       carries it, a refused gh call fails the run, and an unknown argument
#       touches nothing.
#   Any other argument, --help included, prints this usage and exits 2
#   before any gh call.
