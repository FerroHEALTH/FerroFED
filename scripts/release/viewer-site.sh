# Builds the operator console's site bundle (app/ferrofed-viewer) with
# cargo-leptos, with the workspace lockfile frozen, and checks the bundle is
# whole (no specification governs this: our own design).
#
# cargo-leptos resolves the workspace through its own `cargo metadata` call,
# which takes no --locked, and cargo has no environment variable for it. So
# the lockfile is checked with `cargo metadata --locked` first, which fails
# loud when Cargo.lock does not satisfy every manifest and leaves the second
# resolution nothing to change, and --locked is passed to the compile itself.
#
# The bundle is target/site: pkg/ferrofed-viewer.wasm, its JavaScript glue,
# the stylesheet, and the favicon cargo-leptos copies from the crate's
# public/. The server binary is built apart from it, with cargo, because the
# bundle is the same for every architecture.
#
# Usage: scripts/release/viewer-site.sh [--release]
