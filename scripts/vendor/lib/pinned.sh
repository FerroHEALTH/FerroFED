# Shared helpers for the corpora pinned file by file, by URL and sha256.
#
# A national publication (a statute page, a PDF, a FHIR package served from a
# build URL, a Confluence page) has no git commit to pin, so each artefact is
# pinned by the URL it is fetched from and the sha256 of its bytes. A country
# script calls `pinned_begin` once, then for each corpus declares its
# artefacts with `pin` and calls `pinned_corpus`, which:
#
# - checks the pins against the corpus row of docs/VERSIONS.md, whose Pin
#   cell carries the pin-set digest (sha256 over the sorted
#   `mode  file  url  sha256` lines), so changing any pin changes the matrix;
# - downloads every artefact into a scratch directory and fails, before it
#   touches the tree, when any sha256 differs from its pin;
# - writes each `commit` artefact verbatim under docs/specs/<corpus>/, each
#   `cache` artefact under the git-ignored .vendor-cache/<corpus>/, and
#   fetches nothing for a `manual` row (a source behind a login or a bot
#   challenge);
# - writes docs/specs/<corpus>/PROVENANCE.md, which names every artefact, its
#   URL, version, sha256 and licence, whatever its mode.
#
# A `cache` artefact is material whose licence does not allow redistribution,
# or whose licence is unclear: it is read locally and never committed.
# Re-running with unchanged pins and unchanged upstream bytes reproduces the
# tree byte for byte; only the fetch date in PROVENANCE.md moves.
#
# With PINNED_DIGESTS_ONLY=1 a script prints each corpus and its pin-set
# digest and fetches nothing, which is how a re-pin reads the digest it
# writes into docs/VERSIONS.md.
#
# Requires: curl, shasum, awk, and scripts/vendor/lib/corpus.sh sourced first.
#
# No specification governs this file; it is FerroFED's own design.

Vendored by \`scripts/vendor/$corpus_script.sh\`, each artefact pinned by its
URL and the sha256 of its bytes. Never edit a file here: change the pins in
the script and the pin-set digest in docs/VERSIONS.md, and re-run the script.

- Pin-set digest (sha256 over the sorted \`mode  file  url  sha256\` lines of
  the pins): \`$digest\`
- Fetched: $fetched, with the User-Agent \`$ua\`
- Artefacts: $n_commit committed, $n_cache cache only, $n_manual needing
  manual retrieval
- Files in this directory: $files besides this one, each verbatim as the
  publisher serves it
- Tree digest (sha256 over the sorted per-file \`sha256  path\` listing,
  \`PROVENANCE.md\` excluded): \`$tree\`

  localization, consent, addressing and authentication to nodes)
