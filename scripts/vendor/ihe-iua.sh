# Vendors the IHE Internet User Authorization (IUA) Technical Framework
# Supplement into docs/specs/ihe-iua/: the supplement's Markdown source, which
# defines Get Access Token [ITI-71], Incorporate Access Token [ITI-72],
# Introspect Token [ITI-102] and Get Authorization Server Metadata
# [ITI-103], its figures, and the repository's licence file.
#
# Client authentication (#80) reads the IUA access token claims of ITI-71
# (`extensions.ihe_iua`) and the bearer presentation of ITI-72, so the text it
# is held to is pinned here (#414).
#
# IUA is published as a supplement in IHE's own repository, with no FHIR
# package. The "IHE IUA supplement" row of docs/VERSIONS.md pins a tag; a tag
# is mutable, so the script resolves it to a commit, records the commit and
# the git blob id of each file, and checks that the supplement declares the
# revision the tag names.
#
# Redistribution: the repository is licensed CC-BY-4.0 (its LICENSE, vendored
# beside the text), and the IHE Technical Frameworks General Introduction §9
# grants every user a licence to reproduce and distribute IHE Technical
# Documents under IHE International's copyrights. The script fails if the
# licence file stops being CC-BY-4.0.
#
# Usage:

# Provenance: the IHE IUA Technical Framework Supplement

Vendored verbatim by \`scripts/vendor/ihe-iua.sh\`. Never edit a file here:
change the pin in docs/VERSIONS.md and re-run the script.

- Source: <https://github.com/$repo>, rendered at
  <https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/IUA/index.html>
- Pin: tag \`$tag\`, which resolves to commit \`$commit\`
- Document: Internet User Authorization (IUA), Revision $revision - $status,
  dated $published
- Fetched: $fetched
- Upstream licence: the repository's \`LICENSE\`, Creative Commons
  Attribution 4.0 International, vendored beside this file. The IHE
  Technical Frameworks General Introduction §9
  (<https://profiles.ihe.net/GeneralIntro/ch-9.html>) also grants every user
  of IHE Technical Documents a licence to reproduce and distribute them under
  IHE International's copyrights. The supplement reproduces no table of a
  base standard; it refers to OAuth 2.0 RFCs and HL7 FHIR by link.
- Layout: the upstream paths, unchanged
- Files: $files
- Tree digest (sha256 over the sorted per-file \`sha256  path\` listing,
  \`PROVENANCE.md\` excluded): \`$digest\`
- Read by: #414 (client authentication's citations of ITI-71 and ITI-72,
  held to the vendored section headings by the server's citation test)

## What is taken

\`$supplement\` is the supplement's whole text: Volume 1 §34 (the IUA
profile) and Volume 2 §3.71 Get Access Token [ITI-71], §3.72 Incorporate
Access Token [ITI-72], §3.102 Introspect Token [ITI-102] and §3.103 Get
Authorization Server Metadata [ITI-103]. \`media/\` is the upstream
directory whole: the figures the text links and the slide deck the actor
diagrams are drawn in, which the text does not link but which is kept so
the directory stays as the publisher ships it. The repository's build
script, stylesheet, code system, issue templates and README are not taken.
The status is the document's own: a Trial Implementation supplement may be
amended before it is incorporated into the Technical Framework.
