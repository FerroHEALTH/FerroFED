# docs/specs/w3c-did-vc/: the Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.1 (the
# credential and presentation, and their JWT encoding of §6.3.1), Decentralized
# Identifiers 1.0, DID Resolution, Bitstring Status List 1.0 and the did:web
# Method Specification.
#
# The access token request of crates/nl-generic-functions feature
# `nuts-auth` (#88) builds its Verifiable Presentation to VC Data Model 1.1
# §4.10 and §6.3.1, names its holder by a did:web identifier (DID 1.0 §3,
# the did:web method) and signs it with a key a DID URL names.
#
# The W3C documents are dated publications, pinned by URL and sha256 in their
# docs/VERSIONS.md rows; the did:web method is a Credentials Community Group
# report kept in a repository, pinned by commit.
#
# Redistribution: the W3C documents are published under the W3C Software and
# Document License, which grants permission to copy and distribute them in

# script fails if a document stops naming that licence.

# Provenance: the W3C identifier and credential specifications

Vendored verbatim by \`scripts/vendor/w3c-did-vc.sh\`. Never edit a file here:
change the pins in docs/VERSIONS.md and re-run the script.

- Source: the W3C Technical Reports, <https://www.w3.org/TR/>, each at its
  dated URL, and the Credentials Community Group repository
  <https://github.com/$repo>
- Pins, one row of docs/VERSIONS.md each:$pins
- did:web Method Specification: commit \`$commit\` of \`$repo\`, its
  \`index.html\` (the report's source) and \`LICENSE.md\`
- Fetched: $fetched
- Upstream licence: the W3C documents carry the W3C copyright notice and
  name the W3C Software and Document License, the 2015 text
  (<$licence_2015>) for the two 2022 Recommendations and the 2023 text
  (<$licence_2023>) for the later documents; both permit
  copying and distributing the documents in any medium for any purpose,
  provided the URL of the original, the copyright notice and the status of the
  document are kept; each file is the original, unmodified, with all three.
  The did:web repository's \`LICENSE.md\`, vendored in
  \`did-method-web/\`, licenses its reports under the same licence.
- Layout: one file per W3C document, named for it; \`did-method-web/\` at the
  repository's own paths
- Files: $files
- Tree digest (sha256 over the sorted per-file \`sha256  path\` listing,
  \`PROVENANCE.md\` excluded): \`$digest\`
- Read by: #88 (the Verifiable Presentation of the access token request of
  \`crates/nl-generic-functions\` feature \`nuts-auth\`: VC Data Model 1.1
  §4.10 and §6.3.1, and the did:web holder identifier)

## What is taken

The documents the GF-Authentication pages of the Netherlands Generic
Functions IG cite for the entity identifier (DID 1.0, the did:web method and
DID Resolution, GFI-001), the credential and its presentation (VC Data Model
1.1, GFI-002 and GFI-004) and revocation (Bitstring Status List 1.0,
GFI-003). DID Resolution and Bitstring Status List are the verifier's side of
the exchange; they are taken because the IG binds them, so the record of
what the track requires is complete.
