# Vendors the IHE Basic Audit Log Patterns (BALP) 1.1.4 FHIR package into
# docs/specs/ihe-balp/, every file of it but the package manifest: each
# pattern an audit record of crates/ihe-iti (feature `balp`, #486) or an
# access record can name, among them Query, Patient Query, Read, Create,
# Update and Delete and their Patient variants, the Audit Creator and Audit
# Record Repository capability statements, the code systems and value sets,
# and the IG's examples. The PIXm, mCSD, PDQm and PMIR audit profiles are
# built on these patterns. The package manifest is read for its name, version
# and licence and left out of the tree (the dependency-manifest rule of
# scripts/vendor/lib/corpus.sh).
#
# The "IHE BALP FHIR package" row of docs/VERSIONS.md pins the package by
# version and by the sha256 of the registry tarball, so a republished package
# under the same version fails the fetch instead of changing the tree.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/vendor/ihe-balp.sh
#
# Requires: curl, tar, shasum, jq.

# Provenance: the IHE BALP FHIR package

Vendored verbatim by \`scripts/vendor/ihe-balp.sh\`. Never edit a file here:
change the pin in docs/VERSIONS.md and re-run the script.

- Source: <$url>, the FHIR package registry's copy of the IG published at
  <https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/BALP/$version/>
- Pin: package \`$name\` version \`$version\`, tarball sha256 \`$want\`
- Fetched: $fetched
- Upstream licence: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
  (\`$licence\`, the \`license\` of the package manifest, listed under What is
  left out;
  <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>). The package ships no licence
  file of its own. Attribution: IHE International, IT Infrastructure Technical
  Committee, *Basic Audit Log Patterns (BALP)* $version.
- FHIR version: $fhir
- Layout: the upstream paths inside the package, unchanged
- Files: $files of the package's $total, listed below
- Tree digest (sha256 over the sorted per-file \`sha256  path\` listing,
  \`PROVENANCE.md\` excluded): \`$digest\`
- Read by: #486 (the BALP audit records of \`crates/ihe-iti\`, whose tests hold
  each record to the pattern its transaction's audit profile derives from and
  a search to the client-side example, and the ATNA FHIR Feed sender, held to
  the Audit Creator's \`create\` interaction) and #696 (every pattern an access
  record names by canonical URL). The narrative pages of the same version are
  in docs/specs/ihe-balp-pages/.

## What is here

The whole package but its manifest: every audit pattern (the RESTful Query,
Read, Create, Update and Delete patterns and their Patient variants, the
OAuth and SAML token-use, consent and privacy disclosure patterns), the Audit
Creator, Audit Consumer and Audit Record Repository capability statements,
the code systems and value sets, the IG's examples, the OpenAPI and
Schematron renderings and the registry's index and validation output.

## What is left out

The package manifest, \`package.json\`. The script reads its name, version
and licence from the tarball and checks them against the pin. A vendored copy
would make this repository's dependency graph claim an npm package that
depends on \`hl7.fhir.r4.core\`, a FHIR registry package whose name the GitHub
advisory database flags as a malicious npm package; nothing here installs
either.
