# Vendors the IHE ATNA text the gateway's audit trail cites into
# docs/specs/ihe-atna/: the Record Audit Event [ITI-20] page of the IT
# Infrastructure Technical Framework Volume 2 with its one figure (the syslog
# interaction, its store-and-forward trigger, and the audit message format the
# ITI-55 audit message follows, #418), and the RESTful ATNA Technical Framework
# Supplement (the ATX: FHIR Feed Option and the Send Audit Resource
# interaction of ITI-20 the BALP audit records travel over, #486).
#
# Neither text is in a FHIR package or a tagged repository: the page is
# published as HTML at profiles.ihe.net and the supplement as a PDF at
# ihe.net, both at URLs that do not carry a revision. The "IHE ITI-20 Record
# Audit Event" and "IHE RESTful ATNA supplement" rows of docs/VERSIONS.md pin
# each file by its sha256, so a new revision fails the fetch instead of
# changing the tree, and the script checks the revision each document
# declares against the pin.
#
# Redistribution: the IHE Technical Frameworks General Introduction §9 grants
# every user a licence to reproduce and distribute IHE Technical Documents

# Provenance: the IHE ATNA audit text

Vendored verbatim by \`scripts/vendor/ihe-atna.sh\`. Never edit a file here:
change the pins in docs/VERSIONS.md and re-run the script.

- Layout: the page under \`Volume2/\` with its figure at the relative path the
  page links (\`media/\`), the supplement at the top
- Files: $files
- Tree digest (sha256 over the sorted per-file \`sha256  path\` listing,
  \`PROVENANCE.md\` excluded): \`$digest\`
- Read by: #418 (the ITI-20 syslog sender of \`crates/ihe-iti\`, feature
  \`atna\`) and #486 (its ATX: FHIR Feed sender, feature \`balp\`), whose tests
  hold the store-and-forward of §3.20.4.1.1 the spool keeps, and the
  supplement the FHIR Feed follows, to these files

## What is here

\`Volume2/ITI-20.html\` is the whole Record Audit Event transaction: the
Send Audit Event syslog interaction (§3.20.4.1) with its trigger events and
the store-and-forward a sender that cannot reach its repository keeps
(§3.20.4.1.1), the syslog message semantics and transports (§3.20.4.1.2), and
the IHE Audit Trail Message Format (§3.20.7). The page's stylesheets, scripts
and logo serve no reader here and are not taken. The supplement adds the
ATX: FHIR Feed Option (ITI TF-1 §9.2.7.1) and the FHIR Feed interactions of
ITI-20: Send Audit Resource Request (§3.20.4.2), its mapping from the DICOM
audit message to the FHIR \`AuditEvent\` (Table 3.20.4.2.2.1-1) and the
Send Audit Resource Response (§3.20.4.3). The status is the document's own:
a Trial Implementation supplement may be amended before it is incorporated
into the Technical Framework.
