# Vendors the Nuts specifications the GF-Authentication track of Annex B §B.4
# runs on into docs/specs/nuts-rfc/: RFC021, the VP Token Grant Type (the
# Verifiable Presentation as the authorization grant, the Presentation
# Definition endpoint and the access token request); RFC003, OAuth2
# Authorization (the authorization server and access token of the earlier
# Nuts flow, on the RFC 7523 JWT bearer grant the IG's GFI-004 also names);
# and RFC022, the Discovery Service (how a Nuts participant finds the
# authorization server of another).
#
# The access token request of crates/nl-generic-functions feature
# `nuts-auth` (#88) is held to RFC021.
#
# The specifications live on the default branch of their repository, whose
# last tag predates RFC021, so the "Nuts specifications" row of
# docs/VERSIONS.md pins a commit.

## What is taken

The three documents the B.4 track of the Federation Tier specification's
Annex B rests on: RFC021, the grant the client side sends; RFC003, the
authorization server and access token it replaces; and RFC022, the service
discovery a participant reaches another's authorization server through. The
other RFCs (the network, the registry, the credential formats of the earlier
Nuts node) and the repository's images serve no reader here and are not
taken.
